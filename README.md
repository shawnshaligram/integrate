## Write tests

Check out [this document](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/) for Selenium's concepts and operations.

To write new tests, you can either bind mount your python files to the container or create a new Docker image and copy files into the image.
The example code is located at `tests` and `page_objects` in the container. You may overwrite this file or place your files at different locations
